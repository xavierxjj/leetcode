# [Add_Two_Numbers](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/)

Idea:Create a new linked list to store the results, traverse the linked list, and use variables to record the carry. The time complexity is O (n) and the space complexity is O (n). (In order to make the traversal process consistent, a temporary head node is created in the linked list that stores the results, and the next node of the head node is returned.)

思路：新建链表存储结果，遍历链表，使用变量记录进位。时间复杂度为O(n)，空间复杂度为O(n)。（为使遍历过程处理一致，存储结果的链表新建临时头结点，返回时返回头结点的下一个节点。）
